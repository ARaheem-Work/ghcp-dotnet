## Project name and description

- Name: ghcp-dotnet
- Summary: .NET 9.0 console application scaffold. If .github/copilot and copilot-instructions.md exist, extract the authoritative purpose and replace this summary accordingly.

### At-a-glance

- Entry point: `Program.cs` (top-level statements)
- Target framework: `net9.0`
- Root namespace: `ghcp_dotnet`

Links:
- C# guidelines: `.github/instructions/csharp.instructions.md`
- Markdown guidelines: `.github/instructions/markdown.instructions.md`
- README generator prompt: `.github/prompts/readme-blueprint-generator.prompt.md`
- .NET best practices prompt: `.github/prompts/dotnet-best-practices.prompt.md`

## Technology stack

- Language: C# (latest, C# 13 as per repo guidance)
- Runtime/SDK: .NET 9.0 (see `ghcp-dotnet.csproj`)
- Tooling: .NET CLI, VS Code
- OS/devcontainer: Debian (bookworm) base, Git/Node/Azure CLI available

If `.github/copilot/Technology_Stack.md` exists, enumerate exact versions and tools from that file.

## Project architecture

- Minimal console app architecture: a single executable with top-level statements.
- Expand this section with a high-level architecture diagram and components when the project grows.

If `.github/copilot/Architecture.md` exists, summarize its layers, responsibilities, and any data flow.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK installed

### Setup

- Clone, build, and run locally:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd ghcp-dotnet
 dotnet build
 dotnet run
```

- Optional: configure environment variables and app settings if described in `.github/copilot/Project_Folder_Structure.md` or other docs.

## Project structure

- Root
  - `Program.cs` – console entry point
  - `ghcp-dotnet.csproj` – project file
  - `README.md` – project readme (replace with generated one when ready)
  - `.github/` – prompts, chatmodes, instructions

If `.github/copilot/Project_Folder_Structure.md` exists, mirror that structure here with brief descriptions.

## Key features

- Baseline console app scaffolding that compiles and runs on .NET 9
- Ready to adopt repo coding standards and prompts-driven workflows

When feature work begins, extract the authoritative list from `.github/copilot/*` and update.

## Development workflow

- Local: standard Git flow with .NET CLI build/test
- Use prompts in `.github/prompts/` to guide doc and best-practices tasks
- Commit, push, and leverage CI when configured

If `.github/copilot/Workflow_Analysis.md` exists, summarize branching strategy, PR checks, and release tagging.

## Coding standards

- Follow `.github/instructions/csharp.instructions.md`:
  - Use C# 13 features where appropriate
  - Naming: PascalCase for public members; camelCase for locals/privates; prefix interfaces with `I`
  - Prefer file-scoped namespaces and modern pattern matching
  - Add XML docs for public APIs; explain design decisions in comments

- Follow `.github/instructions/markdown.instructions.md` for docs:
  - Use `##`/`###` headings
  - Include YAML front matter in docs that require validation
  - Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers

## Testing

- No tests included yet. Recommended stack:
  - xUnit for unit tests
  - FluentAssertions for expressive assertions

If `.github/copilot/Unit_Tests.md` exists, document the testing strategy, tools, and how to run tests.

## Contributing

- Open issues or draft PRs for discussion
- Align changes with the C# and Markdown instructions
- Reference any code exemplars if provided under `.github/copilot/Code_Exemplars.md`

## License

- License file not found. Add a `LICENSE` file (MIT/Apache-2.0/etc.) and summarize terms here.
